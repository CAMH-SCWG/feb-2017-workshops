#### Because ...

... research is becoming more computational and you've probably never been
formally trained in general computing skills. 

#### That's a problem. 

Software is your experimental apparatus. Just like cleaning test tubes and pipetting, computing is a basic skill you
need to be competent with. 

These workshops will focus on some computing skills fundamentals you'll need
for getting your study data organized, doing repeatable/reproducible analysis,
and making use of existing CAMH computing resources to save time. 

You should attend if you are doing any sort of scientific computing work, or
work that involves repetition that could be automated. 

This time around, we're using a shared dataset - spanning demographic, cognitive, imaging, and genomic data - across all workshops so we can get started faster and increase attendees' exposure to all the great work going on around the hospital
